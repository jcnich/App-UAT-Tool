# A Day in the Sun

Five dogs—**Max**, **Luna**, **Buddy**, **Daisy**, and **Rusty**—woke to a perfect morning. The sky was clear, the grass was soft, and the backyard gate was open.

## Morning

Max, a golden retriever, led the charge outside. He raced to the oak tree and circled it twice before Luna, a sleek greyhound, shot past him. Buddy, a scruffy terrier, dug under the fence and then ran back in just to do it again. Daisy, a fluffy sheepdog, rolled in the cool dew until her coat was a mess. Rusty, an old beagle, sniffed every bush and flower, taking his time.

## Afternoon

By noon they had worn a path around the yard. They shared a water bowl, splashed in a puddle, and chased a squirrel (who escaped up the tree). Luna and Max played tug with a rope toy. Buddy barked at a passing cloud. Daisy napped in the shade. Rusty dozed in a patch of sun, twitching in his dreams.

## Evening

As the light turned golden, the five of them lay in a loose circle on the grass. Tired, happy, and a little muddy, they watched the first stars appear. Then one by one they trotted inside—full of fresh air and the memory of a very good day.
